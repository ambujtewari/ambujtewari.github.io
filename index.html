My research group is engaged in fundamental research in the following areas:

<ul>
<li>
Statistical learning theory: We are developing theory and algorithms for
predictions problems (e.g., learning to rank and multilabel learning) with complex label
spaces and where the available human supervision is often weak. Another focus
is on dependent and/or non-stationary data (such as in time series
applications)
</li>
<li>
Sequential prediction in a game theoretic framework: We are trying to
understand the power and limitations of sequential prediction algorithms
when no probabilistic assumptions are placed on the data generating mechanism.
</li>
<li>
High dimensional and network data analysis: We are developing scalable algorithms with
provable performance guarantees for learning from high dimensional and network
data.
</li>
<li>
Optimization algorithms: We are creating incremental, distributed and parallel
algorithms for machine learning problems arising in today's data rich world.
</li>
<li>
Reinforcement learning: We are synthesizing and further developing concepts and techniques from
artificial intelligence, control theory and operations research for pushing
forward the
frontier in sequential decision making with a focus on delivering personalized
health interventions via mobile devices.  Here is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTx2G7qidDQ">a short video</a> from a talk I gave at NYAS
and <a href="http://home.isr.umich.edu/sampler/just-in-time/">an article</a> from ISR Sampler.
</li>
</ul>

I like to work in multi-disciplinary teams and am currently interested in
machine learning problems in several scientific areas, especially behavioral sciences,
chemistry, learning sciences, life sciences, and medicine.
I gratefully acknowledge early career support provided by an <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1452099">NSF CAREER grant</a> (2015) and a <a href="https://sloan.org/fellowships/">Sloan Research Fellowship</a> (2017).
